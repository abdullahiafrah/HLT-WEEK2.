            Who wrote ‘Wheels on the Bus’?</p>
        <p2>
            ‘Wheels on the Bus’ is attributed to Verna Hills, and was published in 1939.
It is an American folk song for children, popular in America, Canada, the UK and Australia, designed to keep young ones amused on long bus rides.
It has a cheerful, rhythmic melody that’s repeated again and again, and used throughout several verses – the final of which sees parents saying “shh, shh, shh”. You’ve got to applaud the ingenuity of the device being utilised there... *chuckles*.
The melody is closely based on the similarly rhythmic and repetitive British children’s song, ‘Here we go Round the Mulberry Bush’. </p>
